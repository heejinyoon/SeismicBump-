# SeismicBump-
waiLEARN Machine learning Group project to predict Seismic Bump.
We were making machine learning model which is early predicting sepsis patient in ICU. However our dataset had lots of null, empty values so even though we did perfect work for data exploration and preparation our test accuracy was not perfect after trained model. So we decided using Nabanita's seismic Bump machine learning project which had perfect dataset but low test accuracy. We tried using the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique to the original data to get highest test accuracy. And our test results was satisfied. 

I participated part of this project such as data preparation, data exploration, Decision Tree model, logistic Regression model for the sepsis project and also make decision tree model for the sesimic bump project. 
It was nice experience for me to work with amazing team in waiLearn Ireland.
